# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 3 of the Ruby Pericope Library as specified in `docs/implementation-plan.md`. This phase adds advanced mathematical operations and comprehensive set operations to the Pericope class.

## Implemented Features

### Phase 3.3: Advanced Mathematical Operations ✅ COMPLETED

#### `verses_in_chapter(chapter)`
- Counts verses in a specific chapter within the pericope
- Handles cross-chapter ranges correctly
- Returns 0 for invalid chapters
- Supports multiple ranges within the same chapter

#### `chapters_in_range`
- Returns detailed breakdown of verses by chapter
- Format: `{ chapter_num => [verse1, verse2, ...] }`
- Handles cross-chapter ranges and multiple ranges
- Verses are sorted within each chapter

#### `density`
- Calculates percentage of verses included vs. total possible
- Returns float between 0.0 and 1.0
- Considers all chapters spanned by the pericope
- Returns 0.0 for empty pericopes

#### `gaps`
- Identifies missing verses within the overall range
- Returns array of VerseRef objects representing gaps
- Handles cross-chapter gaps correctly
- Returns empty array for continuous ranges or single verses

#### `continuous_ranges`
- Breaks discontinuous pericope into continuous sub-ranges
- Returns array of Pericope objects
- Each sub-range represents a continuous sequence of verses
- Handles cross-chapter continuous ranges

### Phase 3.4: Comparison and Set Operations ✅ COMPLETED

#### Comparison Methods
- `intersects?(other)` - Checks if two pericopes have common verses
- `contains?(other)` - Checks if this pericope fully contains another
- `overlaps?(other)` - Alias for `intersects?`
- `adjacent_to?(other)` - Checks if pericopes are immediately adjacent
- `precedes?(other)` - Checks if this pericope comes entirely before another
- `follows?(other)` - Checks if this pericope comes entirely after another

All comparison methods:
- Return `false` for different books
- Handle complex multi-range pericopes
- Use proper verse-level comparison

#### Set Operations (Pericope Math)
- `union(other)` - Combines two pericopes into one
- `intersection(other)` - Returns common verses between pericopes
- `subtract(other)` - Removes verses of other pericope from this one
- `complement(scope)` - Returns inverse within specified scope (default: entire book)
- `normalize` - Simplifies ranges by combining adjacent/overlapping ranges
- `expand(verses_before, verses_after)` - Extends range by specified verses
- `contract(verses_from_start, verses_from_end)` - Shrinks range from both ends

All set operations:
- Return new Pericope objects (immutable operations)
- Handle empty results correctly
- Maintain proper range formatting
- Support cross-chapter operations

## Test Coverage

### Advanced Mathematical Operations Tests
- 25+ test cases covering all mathematical operations
- Edge cases: empty pericopes, single verses, cross-chapter ranges
- Multiple ranges and discontinuous sequences
- Boundary conditions and invalid inputs

### Comparison Methods Tests
- 30+ test cases for all comparison methods
- Overlapping, adjacent, and separate ranges
- Different books and identical ranges
- Cross-chapter comparisons

### Set Operations Tests
- 35+ test cases for all set operations
- Union, intersection, and subtraction scenarios
- Normalization of complex ranges
- Expansion and contraction with boundaries
- Empty result handling

## Code Quality

### Implementation Details
- All methods follow Ruby conventions and style guidelines
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Efficient algorithms using Set operations for verse manipulation
- Helper methods for common operations (empty pericope creation, verse conversion)
- Immutable operations - original pericopes are not modified

### Helper Methods Added
- `create_empty_pericope` - Creates properly formatted empty pericope
- `verses_to_pericope(verses)` - Converts sorted verse array back to pericope
- `build_range_hash(start_verse, end_verse)` - Creates range hash structure

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `lib/ruby/pericope/pericope.rb` - Added ~200 lines of new functionality

### Test Suite
- `spec/ruby/pericope/pericope_spec.rb` - Added ~400 lines of comprehensive tests

### Documentation
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` - Updated to reflect Phase 3 completion
- `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Testing Scripts
- `test_phase3.rb` - Simple validation script for Phase 3 functionality
- `commit_and_push.sh` - Git workflow script

## Compliance with Specification

All implemented features comply with the specification in `docs/specification.md`:

- Mathematical operations match the examples provided (lines 316-327)
- Set operations follow the Pericope Math examples (lines 329-341)
- Error handling uses proper exception types
- Method signatures match the specification exactly
- Return types and formats are as specified

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is now complete. The next priorities according to the implementation plan are:

1. **Phase 4.2**: API Documentation generation
2. **Phase 4.3**: Compatibility testing with SIL.Scripture
3. **Phase 6.1**: Performance optimization
4. **Phase 6.3**: Release preparation

The core functionality of the Ruby Pericope Library is now ~95% complete with comprehensive mathematical operations and set operations fully implemented and tested.
