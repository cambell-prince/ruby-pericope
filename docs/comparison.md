- **Functional Approach**: Heavy use of class methods and module functions
- **Regex-Heavy Parsing**: Complex regex patterns for book recognition and parsing
- **Established Codebase**: Mature, stable implementation with proven track record
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Simple, lightweight design

## Core Features Comparison

### 1. Book Recognition & Management

#### This Library
```ruby
# Multiple discovery methods
genesis = Pericope::Book.find_by_code("GEN")
matthew = Pericope::Book.find_by_name("Matthew")
corinthians = Pericope::Book.find_by_name("1 Corinthians")

# Fuzzy matching with sophisticated algorithms
mathew = Pericope::Book.find_by_name("Mathew") # finds "Matthew"

# Rich book metadata
genesis.old_testament?    # true
genesis.chapter_count     # 50
genesis.aliases          # ["Gen", "Genesis", "Gn", ...]

# Testament organization
old_books = Pericope::Book.testament_books(:old)
new_books = Pericope::Book.testament_books(:new)
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Simple book name recognition via regex
Pericope.new("ps 118:17").to_s  # => "Psalm 118:17"
Pericope.new("jas 3:1-5").to_s  # => "James 3:1-5"
Pericope.new("1 jn 4:4").to_s   # => "1 John 4:4"

# Book information accessed through constants
book_name = Pericope::BOOK_NAMES[book_id]
chapter_count = Pericope::BOOK_CHAPTER_COUNTS[book_id]
```

**Winner**: This library provides significantly more sophisticated book management with better organization and metadata.

### 2. Verse Reference Handling

#### This Library
```ruby
# Dedicated VerseRef class
verse = Pericope::VerseRef.new("GEN", 1, 1)
verse.to_s              # "GEN 1:1"
verse.to_i              # 1001001 (BBBCCCVVV format)
verse.before?(other)    # Comparison methods
verse.next_verse        # Navigation
verse.previous_verse    # Navigation
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Verse represented as internal Verse class
# Limited public API for individual verse manipulation
# Verses primarily accessed through pericope ranges
array = Pericope.new("gen 1:1-3").to_a # => [1001001, 1001002, 1001003]
```

**Winner**: This library provides a much richer API for individual verse manipulation.

### 3. Pericope Parsing & Creation

#### This Library
```ruby
# Multiple creation methods
pericope = Pericope::Pericope.new("GEN 1:1-3")
pericopes = Pericope::Pericope.parse(text)  # Extract from text
segments = Pericope::Pericope.split(text)   # Split text on pericopes

# Rich metadata
pericope.verse_count        # 3
pericope.chapter_count      # 1
pericope.range_count        # 1
pericope.single_verse?      # false
pericope.spans_chapters?    # false
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Single creation method
pericope = Pericope.new("gen 1:1-3")
pericopes = Pericope.parse(text)    # Extract from text
segments = Pericope.split(text)     # Split text on pericopes

# Basic enumeration
pericope.each { |verse| ... }       # Iterate over verses
pericope.to_a                       # Convert to array
```

**Winner**: This library provides more comprehensive metadata and analysis capabilities.

### 4. Mathematical Operations

#### This Library
```ruby
pericope = Pericope::Pericope.new("MAT 5:1,3,5-10,12")

# Advanced mathematical analysis
pericope.verse_count        # 8 (total verses included)
pericope.range_count        # 4 (number of separate ranges)
pericope.density            # 0.32 (proportion of verses in spanned chapters)

# Chapter-specific operations
pericope.verses_in_chapter(5)  # 8 (verses in chapter 5)
chapters = pericope.chapters_in_range
# Returns: {5 => [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]}

# Gap analysis
gaps = pericope.gaps             # [MAT 5:2, MAT 5:4, MAT 5:11]
continuous = pericope.continuous_ranges  # Break into continuous sections
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Basic enumeration only
pericope = Pericope.new("mat 5:1,3,5-10,12")
pericope.count              # Basic count via Enumerable
pericope.to_a.length        # Manual counting
# No built-in mathematical analysis
```

**Winner**: This library provides extensive mathematical operations that are completely absent from the existing library.

### 5. Set Operations

#### This Library
```ruby
a = Pericope::Pericope.new("MAT 5:1-10")
b = Pericope::Pericope.new("MAT 5:5-15")

# Complete set operations
union = a.union(b)               # "MAT 5:1-15"
intersection = a.intersection(b) # "MAT 5:5-10"
difference = a.subtract(b)       # "MAT 5:1-4"
complement = a.complement        # All other verses in scope

# Range manipulation
expanded = a.expand(2, 3)        # Add 2 verses before, 3 after
contracted = a.contract(1, 2)    # Remove 1 from start, 2 from end
normalized = a.normalize         # Simplify and merge ranges
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Only basic intersection
a = Pericope.new("Mark 13:1-6")
b = Pericope.new("Mark 13:5")
a.intersects?(b)  # => true

# No other set operations available
```

**Winner**: This library provides comprehensive set operations while the existing library only supports intersection testing.

### 6. Comparison Operations

#### This Library
```ruby
a = Pericope::Pericope.new("MAT 5:1-5")
b = Pericope::Pericope.new("MAT 5:3-8")

# Rich comparison methods
a.intersects?(b)     # true (overlap detection)
a.contains?(other)   # true (containment)
a.adjacent_to?(c)    # true (adjacency)
a.precedes?(c)       # true (ordering)
a.follows?(other)    # true (ordering)
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
a = Pericope.new("Mark 13:1-6")
b = Pericope.new("Mark 13:5")

# Basic comparison
a.intersects?(b)     # => true
a == b               # Equality
a <=> b              # Ordering via Comparable
```

**Winner**: This library provides more comprehensive comparison operations.

### 7. Output Formatting

#### This Library
```ruby
pericope = Pericope::Pericope.new("GEN 1:1-3")

# Multiple output formats
pericope.to_s(:canonical)    # "GEN 1:1-3"
pericope.to_s(:full_name)    # "Genesis 1:1-3"
pericope.to_s(:abbreviated)  # "GEN 1:1-3"

# Customizable formatting options
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
pericope = Pericope.new("gen 1:1-3")

# Single output format with options
pericope.to_s  # => "Genesis 1:1-3"
pericope.to_s(verse_range_separator: "â€“")  # Custom separators
pericope.to_s(always_print_verse_range: true)  # Force verse ranges
```

**Winner**: Tie - Both libraries support formatting, but with different approaches and capabilities.

### 8. Text Processing

#### This Library
```ruby
text = "In the beginning (GEN 1:1), God created. Later, Jesus taught (MAT 5:3-12)."

# Extract pericopes from text
pericopes = Pericope::Pericope.parse(text)
# => [#<Pericope::Pericope GEN 1:1>, #<Pericope::Pericope MAT 5:3-12>]

# Split text on pericopes
segments = Pericope::Pericope.split(text)
# => ["In the beginning (", #<Pericope::Pericope GEN 1:1>, "), God created..."]
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
text = "In the beginning (GEN 1:1), God created. Later, Jesus taught (MAT 5:3-12)."

# Extract pericopes from text
pericopes = Pericope.parse(text)  # => [Genesis 1:1, Matthew 5:3-12]

# Split text on pericopes
segments = Pericope.split(text)
# => ["In the beginning (", Genesis 1:1, "), God created..."]
```

**Winner**: Tie - Both libraries provide similar text processing capabilities.

### 9. Error Handling

#### This Library
```ruby
# Comprehensive error classes
begin
  Pericope::Pericope.new("INVALID 1:1")
rescue Pericope::InvalidBookError => e
  puts e.message # "Invalid book: 'INVALID'"
end

begin
  Pericope::VerseRef.new("GEN", 0, 1)
rescue Pericope::InvalidChapterError => e
  puts e.message # "Invalid chapter 0 for book GEN"
end

# Additional error types:
# - InvalidVerseError
# - InvalidRangeError
# - ParseError
```

#### Existing Library
```ruby
# Basic error handling
begin
  Pericope.new("invalid reference")
rescue ArgumentError => e
  puts e.message # "no pericope found in invalid reference"
end

# Limited error types, mostly ArgumentError
```

**Winner**: This library provides more comprehensive and specific error handling.
