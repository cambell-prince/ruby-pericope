# In-Depth Review: Pericope Class Architecture

## 1. Pericope Class Data Properties

The `Pericope` class manages the following core data properties:

### Primary Data Properties
- **`@book`** (Book): The biblical book reference (e.g., Genesis, Matthew)
- **`@ranges`** (Array): Collection of verse ranges, each containing:
  - `:start_chapter` - Starting chapter number
  - `:start_verse` - Starting verse number  
  - `:end_chapter` - Ending chapter number
  - `:end_verse` - Ending verse number
- **`@versification`** (Object): Versification system (optional, for handling different Bible versions)
- **`@math_operations`** (MathOperations): Delegate object for mathematical operations

### Derived Properties (computed from core data)
- Verse count, chapter count, chapter list
- First verse, last verse
- Validation state (valid?, empty?, single_verse?, etc.)

## 2. Methods That Must Access Core Data

The following methods require direct access to the core data properties:

### Data Access Methods (Lines 84-159)
- `valid?` - Validates @book and @ranges
- `empty?` - Checks if @ranges is empty
- `single_verse?` - Examines @ranges structure
- `single_chapter?` - Analyzes @ranges for chapter spans
- `spans_chapters?` - Checks @ranges for cross-chapter spans
- `verse_count` - Counts verses across @ranges
- `chapter_count` - Counts unique chapters in @ranges
- `first_verse` / `last_verse` - Finds extremes in @ranges

### Core Functionality Methods
- `initialize` - Sets @book, @ranges, @versification
- `to_s` - Formats @book and @ranges as string
- `to_a` - Converts @ranges to VerseRef array
- `==` - Compares @book and @ranges

### Parsing Methods (Lines 244-342)
- `parse_reference` - Populates @book and @ranges
- `parse_ranges` - Processes range text into @ranges
- `ranges_to_string` - Formats @ranges for output

## 3. Methods That Could Operate Statically

The following methods could be refactored to accept a Pericope as a parameter and operate on its public properties:

### Text Processing Methods (Lines 22-47)
- `self.parse(text, versification)` - Could be moved to a TextProcessor class
- `self.split(text, versification)` - Could be moved to a TextProcessor class

### Mathematical Operations (Lines 162-240)
All mathematical operations are already delegated to MathOperations and could be static:
- `verses_in_chapter`, `chapters_in_range`, `density`, `gaps`, `continuous_ranges`
- `intersects?`, `contains?`, `adjacent_to?`, `precedes?`, `follows?`
- `union`, `intersection`, `subtract`, `complement`, `normalize`, `expand`, `contract`

## 4. MathOperations Analysis

### Confirmation: All Functions Operate on Passed Pericope
âœ… **CONFIRMED**: All functions in `MathOperations` operate on the Pericope passed during initialization (`@pericope`). The class follows proper delegation patterns and does not maintain independent state.

### Proposed Refactoring: Split into MathOperations and SetOperations

#### MathOperations Class (Lines 13-82)
**Purpose**: Mathematical analysis and calculations
```ruby
class MathOperations
  # Analysis methods
  def verses_in_chapter(pericope, chapter)
  def chapters_in_range(pericope)
  def density(pericope)
  def gaps(pericope)
  def continuous_ranges(pericope)
  
  # Comparison methods  
  def intersects?(pericope, other)
  def contains?(pericope, other)
  def adjacent_to?(pericope, other)
  def precedes?(pericope, other)
  def follows?(pericope, other)
end
```

#### SetOperations Class (Lines 135-198)
**Purpose**: Set theory operations that create new Pericopes
```ruby
class SetOperations
  # Set operations
  def union(pericope, other)
  def intersection(pericope, other)
  def subtract(pericope, other)
  def complement(pericope, scope = nil)
  
  # Transformation operations
  def normalize(pericope)
  def expand(pericope, verses_before = 0, verses_after = 0)
  def contract(pericope, verses_from_start = 0, verses_from_end = 0)
end
```

## 5. Pericope Class Text Processing Refactoring

### Proposed TextProcessor Class
The parsing and text-related functions could be extracted into a separate class:

```ruby
class TextProcessor
  def self.parse(text, versification = nil)
    # Extract from Pericope.parse (lines 22-38)
  end
  
  def self.split(text, versification = nil)
    # Extract from Pericope.split (lines 41-47)
  end
  
  def self.format_pericope(pericope, format = :canonical)
    # Extract from Pericope#to_s (lines 50-59)
  end
  
  private
  
  def self.parse_reference(reference_string, versification = nil)
    # Extract parsing logic (lines 244-263)
  end
end
```

### Benefits of Refactoring
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a focused purpose
2. **Testability**: Easier to unit test individual components
3. **Reusability**: Text processing can be used independently
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to parsing logic don't affect core Pericope class

### Recommended Pericope Class Structure After Refactoring
```ruby
class Pericope
  attr_reader :book, :ranges, :versification
  
  # Core data management
  def initialize(reference_string, versification = nil)
  def valid?
  def to_a
  def ==
  
  # Delegate to specialized classes
  def to_s(format = :canonical)
    TextProcessor.format_pericope(self, format)
  end
  
  def union(other)
    SetOperations.union(self, other)
  end
  
  def density
    MathOperations.density(self)
  end
end
```

This architecture would create a cleaner separation of concerns while maintaining the existing public API.
